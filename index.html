    During autumn of 2022, I took the class 
    Surveillance Aesthetics: 
    Provocations About Privacy and Security in the 
    Digital Age, a class co-listed with the University
    of Chicago and the School of the Art Institute of 
    Chicago. As a group of artists and computer scientists,
    we explored the ways our privacy is being treated
    through the technologies we use in our daily lives,
    brainstorming ways to convey this message of digital
    concern through various mediums. br
